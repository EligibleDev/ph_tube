                        <b>var:</b><br>
                        var declarations have function scope, meaning they are accessible throughout the entire function
                        in which they are declared.
                        If declared outside any function, they become global variables and are accessible throughout the
                        entire program.<br><br>
                        <b>let:</b><br>

                        let declarations have block scope, which confines them to the block (enclosed by curly braces
                        {}) in which they are defined.
                        Variables declared with let are only accessible within the block where they are
                        declared.<br><br>
                        <b>const:</b><br>

                        const declarations also have block scope, just like let.
                        However, const variables must be assigned a value when declared, and they cannot be reassigned
                        to a different value after that assignment.
                        While the variable itself cannot be reassigned, if the value is an object or array, the
                        properties or elements of the object or array can be modified. <br><br>
                        In summary, var has broader scope (function or global), let has a narrower scope (block), and
                        const is like let but enforces immutability for the variable itself (although its contents can
                        still be changed if it's an object or array). These scoping rules help ensure that variables are
                        used where and how they are intended, reducing potential bugs and unintended side effects in
                        your JavaScript code.

                        <b>null:</b><br>

                        null is used to represent the intentional absence of any object value or value in general. It is
                        typically assigned by the programmer to indicate that a variable, object property, or function
                        return should have no value.
                        For example, you might use null to reset a variable that previously held an object reference or
                        to indicate that a function didn't return a valid result. <br><br>
                        <b>undefined:</b><br>

                        undefined is the default value for variables and object properties that have been declared but
                        haven't been assigned a value. It indicates that the value is missing or uninitialized.
                        It's often seen as a result when accessing properties or variables that don't exist, or when a
                        function doesn't explicitly return a value.
                        It can also be explicitly assigned to variables or properties to indicate that they are meant to
                        have no value or haven't been set yet. <br><br>
                        In summary, null is used to represent intentional absence or lack of value, while undefined is
                        typically used to indicate that a variable or property has not been assigned any value or that a
                        function doesn't return a value. Both are important for handling and managing data in JavaScript
                        programs.

                        REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is
                        a set of architectural principles and constraints used for designing networked applications and
                        services. It is a style of designing networked applications where resources are defined and
                        manipulated using a small, predefined set of operations.
